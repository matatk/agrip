                  "ZQuake" QuakeWorld Server (zqwsv) 0.098
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. About the ZQuake Project (or more specifically, about the zquake-server)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZQuake-server (zqwsv) - is basically your plain-vanilla QW-server with some
minor additions.  One of the more outstanding ones is the ability to play
on a localhost server with a ping of 14, without using priority.exe!  Also,
jumps are fixed in zqwsv (if you wish for them to be as they were in qwsv,
use pm_jumpfix 0).  And, finally, on zqwsv you can play with quake monsters
(as long as you install a special mod, which is available for download at
zquake.frag.ru)!


2. List of New Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* cmdlist - lists all commands
* cvarlist - lists all console variables (cvars)
* toggle - toggles (inverts) value of a cvar (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1)
* unalias - destroys an already existing alias
* set - creates/changes a cvar
* inc - increments a cvar by 1 or by the second parameter if it is
	specified (if the second parameter is negative, it decrements)


3. List of New CVars (default value is in the parenthesis)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* pm_jumpfix (1) - fixes the jump bug

* pm_ktphysics (0) - mmm I don't recommend fiddling with this one :)
  it sets the Kombat Teams slope-jump physics on and off, and is usually
  used in the client (zqwcl) for games played on KT servers, and setting it
  to 1 on the server is discouraged.

* pm_slidefix (0) - upon decsension from a sloped surface, the player doesnt
  "drop" (which is a bug in QW), but smoothly "slides" (as in NQ).

* sys_sleep (8 for Win9x, 0 for WinNT) - idle time, in milliseconds, during
  which the server process idles and lets other processes execute.  I do not
  recommend playing around with this cvar either, maybe you won't hang the
  system but you might slow it down quite a lot.

* coop (0) - co-op play (for single player)
* skill (1) - skill level (for single player)


4. Priority fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When loaded, zqwsv sets its process priority to the highest possible
(HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS).  This is necessary in order for a localhost game
under Win98 not to exhibit high PL (which, in regular qwsv, can reach as
high as 50%+).  If for some unknown reason you wish to disable this
automatic priority setting, run zqwsv with the -nopriority command parameter:
zqwsv -nopriority
