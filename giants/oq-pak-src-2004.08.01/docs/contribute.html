<h1>Open Quartz - Contribute!</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/">Open
Quartz</a> is a project to supply GPL artwork to create
a fully GPL game based around the GPL quake sourcecode.
We have some new models, maps, and textures, but we still
need more contributions.  (See our <a href="todo.html">to do
list</a> Contributed files must be free of copyright
restrictions which would conflict with the GNU
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
License.</a>
</p>

<p>
We can use works licensed under the GPL or anything less
restrictive.  For example some of the Open Quartz content
is GPL, but some of it is free with no restrictions (effectively
&quot;public domain&quot;.)  Some of it is free as long as the
author receives credit - such as including a basic copyright
notice - something which is also important for GPL works, so
we don't beleive this is more restrictive than the GPL.
</p>

<p>
It is best for these files to be in the highest quality
non-lossy source format available:
</p>

<ul>
<li>original model formats are prefered to the very low precision .mdl format
<li>.wav files are preferred to .mp3 files which use lossy compression
<li>24 bit images are better than 8 bit images generated from 24 bit images
<li>instead of lossy .jpg images, use lossless image formats (png, pcx, tga, bmp)
</ul>

<p>
There are several ways to contribute files:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We invite you to join our discussion on the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=1760">openquartz-general
mailing list</a> and announce the contribution there.
<li>If you aren't subscribed to the list, you can e-mail <a href=
"mailto:mapes@squawkrpg.net">Greg Mapes</a> or any active maintainer of the Open Quartz project.
<li>The best way to send the files is by putting them somewhere
where we can download them.  If you don't have this option, ask
about sending the files by e-mail. (Do not send files to the
openquartz-general mailing list.)
<li>It is best to let the original author of the work contribute it,
but if they have already released it with a compatible license,
then you can send us a link to it.
