<a name="1"></a><h1>[1] QuakeC</h1>

<p>[1.1] The simplest "TO DO" for QuakeC is changing the item and death
messages to reflect the differences between the Open Quartz models and
regular Quake models.  Is there any reason to keep the old messages
around? Perhaps as a #define?  Removing them should do no harm;  They
could be put back in later if necessary.

See items.qc and client.qc in the pak0/qc and pak0/qc_qw folders
for the item and death messages that Mapes and I came up with.

<p>[1.2] The Quake-C also needs more "merge" work - lots of clean-up
involving all the #ifdef QUAKEWORLD and so on.  It currently works,
but could be a lot cleaner and less redundant.

I assume that it's also okay to generally "clean up" files - removing
unused local variables, superfluous returns at the end of functions,
consistently indenting (especially local variable declarations and
comments within functions which are often unindented in the QC.)

<p>[1.3] Merging monsters into QuakeWorld does not seem like a difficult
project  (See <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/856/2001/5/100/5681798/">this
post</a>)

We should probably make this a #define QW_MONSTERS or something like that,
because it does make the progs.dat noticeably larger. Alternatively we
could make a #define MONSTERS option that applies to normal Quake as well
as QuakeWorld.

<p>[1.4] We should consider some enhancements to the Quake-C like new
entities and new flexibility for existing entities.  For example, a
typical entity spawn function looks like this:

<pre>
void() foo =
{
	precache_model ("progs/foo.mdl");
	setmodel (self, "progs/foo.mdl");
	...
};
</pre>

could be re-written for flexibility like this:

<pre>
void() foo =
{
	if (!self.model) self.model = "progs/foo.mdl");
	precache_model (self.model);
	setmodel (self, self.model);
	...
};
</pre>


<a name="2"></a><h1>[2] Sounds</h1>

<p>[2.1] The two ambient sounds we have (ambience/water1.wav and
ambience/wind2.wav) do not have a "cue list" entry that is required
to make them loop.  Apparently this requires special software, so
somebody with decent sound editing software will have to to do this.

(Alex Malmberg &lt;mailto:malmberg@malmberg.org&gt; may have source for a quick
and dirty utility he wrote to do this.)

<p>[2.2] We need 13 sounds remaining in the "always needed" category:

<pre>
demon/dland2.wav     (thud sound when monsters land)
wizard/hit.wav       (acid splat on wall)
weapons/guncock.wav  (shotgun - tricky name!)
weapons/rocket1i.wav (nailgun - tricky name!)
weapons/spike2.wav   (super nailgun)
weapons/ric1.wav     (ricochet)
weapons/ric2.wav     (ricochet)
weapons/ric3.wav     (ricochet)
weapons/tink1.wav    (they try to trick us, just another ricochet :-)
weapons/grenade.wav  (grenade launcher)
weapons/sgun1.wav    (rocket launcher - tricky name!)
weapons/lhit.wav     (lightning hit)
weapons/lstart.wav   (lightning gun)
</pre>

<p>[2.3] We may need up to 55 sounds from the "needed by some maps" categories
(ambience, buttons, doors, enforcer/enfire.wav, enforcer/enfstop.wav,
items, misc and plats) A complete list can be found <a href="oqsounds.html">in Open Quartz CVS</a>
or at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/gg/oqsounds.html">http://www.planetquake.com/gg/oqsounds.html</a>

<p>[2.4] We have no monster sounds.  We do have models for replacing the
dog ("beetagator"), enforcer ("rackne") knight ("goat demon"), soldier
("FBI/terrorist"), wizard ("pterascragg") and zombie ("zombie tree").

All together these monsters use 41 sounds we don't have yet.  If we get
replacements for the other monsters, they could use up to 51 more sounds.


<a name="3"></a><h1>[3] Sprites</h1>

<p>There are three sprites in Open Quartz - bubbles, explosions, and light
globes.  They would all look better with higher resolution 32 bit color
versions.  The bubbles also need to be smaller.  They should be named like
the sprites but with an underscore, frame number and in .tga format:

<pre>
light globe:

    s_light_0.tga

air bubble:

    s_bubble_0.tga (bigger bubble)
    s_bubble_1.tga (smaller bubble)

explosion:

    s_explod_0.tga
    s_explod_1.tga
    s_explod_2.tga
    s_explod_3.tga
    s_explod_4.tga
    s_explod_5.tga
</pre>


<a name="4"></a><h1>[4] Maps</h1>

<p>[4.1] Aardappel contributed six maps which need some textures replaced
(dm2ish, dm3ish, dm4ish, e1m2ish, q3dm6ish, and ukpak4.)

To do this quickly, we should replace the textures in the .bsp file with
a program like QuArK or Adquedit.  Of course the first step is to look
into the files and list which textures need replacing.  The second step
is to determine what free textures would make good replacements.

In the long run we'll want to be able to recompile these maps without any
weird bugs.  That might take a little work since these maps are not saved
with full floating point precision.

<p>[4.2] Aardappel's maps will give us a much better selection of non-void DM
levels, but we will still have very little single player content.  Single
player may not be the most important part of the game, but it is important
for first impressions.

A quick way to add single player (SP) levels might be to add SP content to
some DM levels, but most DM levels won't make very good SP levels.

If you have any incomplete SP levels, you might want to touch them up (or
leave them as-is if you don't have time for that) and donate them so we
can work them into Open Quartz.

<p>[4.3] Maps are probably the easiest way to expand and improve the game, so
we need to do whatever we can to make mapping for Open Quartz easy.  What
can we do in this area?  We might want to put out a "developer kit" with
free textures and perhaps special "add-ons" for some editors.

Open Quartz mapping is very much like Quake mapping - the entities are
currently exactly the same, but the textures and executables are different.
Some editors might have trouble figuring out where to put OQ maps, or like
QuArK they might look for id's textures.

<p>[4.4] Some engines (like Darkplaces) can use 32 bit .tga format versions
of textures, so we might be able to make some maps look better by using
textures that have more colors (they can also be higher resolution just by
using a larger .tga texture than the original texture size, but of course
it's important to be careful about mixing textures of different resolution
in a level.)


<a name="5"></a><h1>[5] Models</h1>

<p>[5.1] We lack several monster replacements: blob, boss1/cthon, boss2/shub,
demon/feind, fish, hellknight, ogre, shalrath/vore and shambler.  These are
not extremely high priority, but single player mappers might find them
useful.  Multiple replacements for a single monster are also welcome.

<p>[5.2] With some engines (like Darkplaces) we can use 32 bit .tga format
skins on models, so this would be one way to enhance the current models.
These skins can also be larger than the skins currently used, so they
can have more detail as well as more colors.
 

<a name="6"></a><h1>[6] Utilities</h1>

<p>[6.1] QBSP - I haven't been able to compile the Open Quartz start map with
our custom QBSP so we may need to do more testing and debugging of this
utility before we can rely on it for building all our maps.

(This might be related to newly added QBSP features like floating point
coords or QuArK's //TX texture alignment system - which are in our QBSP,
but not thoroughly tested.)

<p>[6.2] Light - lots of possible T0 DOs for this utility:

<ul>
<li>Negative lights must come after positive lights in the map file.
	An easy fix is to make two passes over the lights, doing normal
	lights on the first pass and negative lights on the second.
<li>Correct lighting with oddly stretched ("sheared") texture alignment?
<li>Colored lighting (.lit files supported by many engines)
<li>Gouraud and/or phong lighting for smooth curved shapes
<li>Light-emitting surfaces (maybe even radiosity)
<li>Sunlight - can be implemented first as an all-purpose directional
	light ignoring walls, and eventually proper shadows implemented.
	Actually, that's fairly easy. For each light sample, cast a ray in
	the sun direction, and if it hits a sky polygon, add some light.
<li>Ambient light - can be implmented first as a global effect (like the
	r_ambient cvar) then ambient light only from sky polygons and
	eventually proper shadows and all that could be added.
</ul>

<p>[6.3] There is a bug involving dependency checking in the utils makefile
(see <a href="../utils/qutils/history.txt">utils/qutils/history.txt</a>)

<p>[6.4] Is PNG image support needed for texmake or will we use that utility?

<p>[6.5] The raw2map terrain convertor could use better image format support

<p>It has been suggested that image format support should be added to the
common library, preferably in a clean way.  Seth Galbraith used libpng
to get modelgen, qlumpy and sprgen to work with .png images.  libpng is
easy to use and .png format is widely supported, so that may be a simpler
alternative than supporting multiple image formats.

<p>[6.6] The mesh2map convertor basically works, but seems to still have some
bugs.  When I try to convert the OQ player model into brushes it takes a
lot of trial and error to find all the brushes that cause compiling
problems. Texture alignment is not really tested.

Support for more 3D file formats could make this a very useful utility.

<p>[6.7] Most of the utilities are poorly documented or not at all. Complete
documentation would be a great thing.  It would also help people use all
the neat little tricks we've added.
