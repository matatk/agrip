Basically I just modified the messages in the game to sound cool and not lame for GPL's supiorier weapons.  Like the glocks!  Anyways, I changed the messages that are printed to the screen in the item.qc and the death messages/all the rest of it in the client.qc

I DID make one other change!  I modified the code slightly so when either the Mac-10 or the rocket launcher use a attacker, target string rather then the normal way. 

Take the progs.dat and place it in your root folder of your GPL folder.  In other words. place it next to your pak0.pak.

I added bots and a couple other other features like monster deathmatch and respawnable explosive boxes in monster deathmatch.

I also changed the monster death messages so they would fit the monsters that we have.
