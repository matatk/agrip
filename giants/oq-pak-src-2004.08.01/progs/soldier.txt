You can do whatever you want with any of these models, as long as you give me credit for making them. I'd also like to see what changes you've made to the models, but I won't require you to do this.

The FBI/Terrorist is my best model to date, and was made for the FBI TC at http://www.mdqnet.net/ , which, as far as I know, is still being worked on. The model has an FBI skin an a Terrorist skin, and includes all of the regular player animations and then some. This is probably going to be my last Quake 1 model since I'm hoping to move on to creating models for more recent games like Quake 3 or Half-Life.
