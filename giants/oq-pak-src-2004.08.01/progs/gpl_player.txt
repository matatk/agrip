Original completion Thursday August 10, 2000

New version Thursday, May 10, 2001
 * full skeletally animated, textured model in .ms3d format
 * cartoon outline version created by adding extra triangles
 * models exported in MilkShape3D ASCII format (.txt files)
 * .qc files containing data needed to "compile" .mdl files

This model was created using Mete Ciragen's MilkShape3D modeling
and animation program: http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft

A little editing was still needed after compiling to .mdl format
MilkShape3D currently creates an extra frame called "base"
This frame had to be deleted from the .mdls after compiling
