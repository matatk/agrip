Basically I just modified the messages in the game to sound cool and not
lame for GPL's supiorier weapons.  Like the glocks!  Anyways, I changed
the messages that are printed to the screen in the item.qc and the death
messages/all the rest of it in the client.qc

I DID make one other change!  I modified the code slightly so when either
the Mac-10 or the rocket launcher use a attacker, target string rather
then the normal way. 

Take the progs.dat and place it in your root folder of your GPL folder.
In other words. place it next to your pak0.pak.

Added merged QC folder (qc_merge) by Alexander Malmberg - requires new qcc
This does not have the new Open Quartz messages which match the Open Quartz graphics
