// AudioQuake Server Config File

// Please edit this file to customise your server.  There are four main
// sections.  You must edit the first section and you'll probably want to at
// least read through the other three to ensure they're to your liking.  You
// will probably want to edit the last line of the file; after all the options
// have been set, the map specifed there is opened.

// We strongly recommend that you read the fine manual, by the way :-)!

// Depending on the speed of your 'net connection, you may need to alter some
// settings.  This config file was created for 512k ADSL with an upstream of
// 256k (the standard upstream rate around here is half of the downstream).


// Section 1: Things you definitely need to change

// Set the server's name...
hostname "UNCONFIGURED AudioQuake Server"
// The e-mail address of the server administrator...
serverinfo admin "(unconfigured, report to mail@agrip.org.uk)"
// If you have a server-related web site, you can advertise it here..
serverinfo url "http://www.agrip.org.uk/"
// Password for remote administration of the server...
rcon_password rconpasswd


// Section 2: Gameplay Settings

// Game mode commands.  You can use any supported game mode command
// here, including coop, deathmatch and teamplay.
deathmatch 1
// Are clients allowed to add/remove bots?
// default for allowing bots (toggle) is 1 (on).
serverinfo bots_clientcontrol 1
// The skill level of bots in your own personal games.  There are three skill
// levels:
// 0 - bots stand still when attacking,
// 1 - they follow their enemy linearly when attacking,
// 2 - bots will strafe about their enemy when attacking.
// allowed values: 0 1 2
// default for bot skill (mode) is 1.
serverinfo bots_skill 1
// Use bot padding in coop, dm and teamdm games?
// Bot padding is where a number of bots are spawned to fill in for players.
// They will be replaced as players connect.  You MUST specify the number of
// teams and their names in the next section if you enable this or the game
// will not know how you want to distribute bots.
// Entering 0 disables this option.
// default for number of client spaces to pad with bots is 4.
serverinfo bots_padclients 4
// Map Rotation
// For each map the server could be running, specify the next one.  Make the
// last map refer back to the first (defined on last line of this fiel) and
// you've got a circular map rotation (which is ideal).
// NOTE: If you want the server to start on a map other than the default,
//       you'll need to edit the last line of this file.
localinfo agdm01 agdm02
localinfo agdm02 agdm03
localinfo agdm03 agdm01
// Same Level? Uncomment this to stop the server from chainging to the next
// map in the rotation...
//samelevel 2
// Set game limits...
timelimit 30
fraglimit 30
// Spectators
maxspectators 2
// Is the game pausable by players?
// (It is highly recommended to keep this disabled.)
pausable 0


// Section 3: Further admin settings, you might like to change

// Depending on your Internet connection speed, you'll probably want to alter
// this setting...
maxclients 8
// The number of teams in team games.  This option assists the game when you
// want bots to pad out client slots.  It also allows you to force specific
// team names to be used even if you aren't using the bot padding feature.
// Use the ag_team[1234]name variables to set the team names you want to use.
// default value for number of teams is 2.
serverinfo ag_numteams 2
// Set team 1's name.
// default for team 1's name (string) is red.
serverinfo ag_team1name red
// Set team 2's name.
// default for team 2's name (string) is blue.
serverinfo ag_team2name blue
// Set team 3's name.
// default for team 3's name (string) is green.
serverinfo ag_team3name yellow
// Set team 4's name.
// default for team 4's name (string) is yellow.
serverinfo ag_team4name green
// Allow players to download skins, models, sounds and maps.  This is off by
// default, but if you have a fast (>512k DSL) connection, you might want to
// disable it.
allow_download_skins 0
allow_download_models 0
allow_download_sounds 0
allow_download_maps 0
// Tell the server to advertise with AGRIP's master server (this is highly
// recommended, as it will allow others to connect to your server easily).
// FIXME: disabled for now as there's no master server there; need to sort
//        this out or disable the feature.
setmaster localhost
// The next line enables stats logging and lets us know that stats are
// available for collection by our master server.  It is highly recommended
// to keep this line here as it will allow you to contribute to the AudioQuake
// world-wide stats.  However, if this is a newbie-specific server or you're
// running a LAN party and have your own stats server, you can comment out or
// change this line.  To comment it out, put // at the start.
fraglogfile ; serverinfo fraglogging ON


// Section 4: Things you don't need to change

// Activate some protection against mallicious players...
floodprot 4 8 30
floodprotmsg "You have activated the flood protection and will be silenced for 30 seconds"


// Finally: opening a map...
// Now that all the options have been set, we can start the server on our chosen map.
map agdm01
