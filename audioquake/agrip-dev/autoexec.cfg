// AGRIP SETTINGS FILE

// These commands set up the game for proper AGRIP-style use.

// This file is run when the game starts.  You can change any of these
// settings by using the console within the game, but you must edit this
// file if you want the changes to be made permanent.  If you alter any
// settings in-game, you'll have to restart the object they apply to before
// they take effect (i.e. turn the Navigation helper off and then back on
// again if you have changed its detection range).

// By all means edit this file to tweak the game to your liking!
// The comments should guide you, but if you have problems, please contact
// us via the tech support e-mail address given on our site.

// If you would like more general information on how to play AGRIP,
// please take a look at the guides on our website.

// Please note that variable names all begin with "agv_" and alias names
// all begin with "aga_" to make them easy to identify as part of AGRIP.


// OBJECT TOGGLE SETTINGS

// These settings control which features and devices are activated at startup.

setinfo agv_t_nav 1
// default for nav helper (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_wall_warnings 1
// default for nav helper warning player of near-by walls (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_side_wall_warnings 0
// default for nav warning about walls to the left and right (toggle) is 0 (off)
setinfo agv_t_nav_wall_touch_warnings 1
// When you walk into a wall, you'll always hear an oomph sound.  This setting
// controls whether you hear a persistent sound that tells you you're still
// touching the wall, after the initial oomph.
// default for navigation helper wall touch warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_z_warnings 1
// Z Warnings tell you when you're moving up/down in 3D space.
// default for navigation helper Z warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_haz_warnings 1
// default for navigation helper warning player of hazards (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_side_haz_warnings 1
// default for nav warning player of left and right hazards (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_nav_corner_warnings 1
// Corners could lead to passage ways, alcoves in which enemies are hiding or
// doorways, for example.  The navigation helper scans out in front of the
// player (distance configurable below as the detection range).  If it finds
// a corner (potential left/right turn) it will announce this.
// default for corner warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_d5k 1
// default for D5k (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_esr 1
// The ESR has 3 modes: off, Enemy Detection and Hazard Detection.
// Enemy Detection finds monsters and Players.
// Hazard Detection assts in making jumps (as detected by the nav object)
// If you enable the ESR, it starts in mode 1.  Press the ESR key to
// switch modes.
// If you're pointing (almost) directly at an enemy/friend, you have a lock on
// them. The ESR will alert you to this by altering the sound it makes.  If you
// lose the lock, you'll hear a ricochet sound in the direction that the entity
// you're tracking escaped.  This allows you to home in on them again.
// default for ESR (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_esr_names 1
// If this option is enabled, the ESR will print out the name of any enemy or
// friend that you get a lock on.  This means you can more effectively work in
// a team and allows you to go after your killers :-).
// default for ESR displaying target names (toggle) is 1 (on).
setinfo agv_t_esr_monster_warnings 1
// Allows the ESR to pinpoint the nearest monster for you.
// default for ESR monster warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_esr_enemy_warnings 1
// Allows the ESR to pinpoint the nearest enemy (player or bot) for you.
// If in teamplay modes, this will not sound out your team mates.
// default for ESR enemy warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_esr_friend_warnings 1
// Allows the ESR to pinpoint the nearest friend for you.
// These are classed as the players or bots on your team in a team game.
// default for ESR friend warnings (toggle) is 1 (on)
setinfo agv_t_footsteps 1
// Footsteps will stop if you get stuck on something.
// If you have them turned off and get stuck on something, you'll hear a
// warning sound to let you know.
// default for footsteps (toggle) is 1 (on)


// DETECTION SETTINGS

// These settings control various features of the detection devices available
// in AGRIP.

setinfo agv_nav_detrange 500
// default for navigation object detection distance is 400
setinfo agv_d5k_interval 1
// default for D5k detection interval is 1 second
setinfo agv_d5k_objdist 500
// default for D5k object detection distance is 400
setinfo agv_esr_ztolerance 28
// The ESR detects whether an enemy, monster, or friend is above, below or
// on the same level as the player.  Any being within this number of game
// units above or below the centre of the player is considered to be on the
// same level as the player.  This allows for more realistic detection.
// As a guide, the player is 56 units high.
// default for ESR Z-tolerance is 32.
set agv_mov_turnvalue 22.5
// This value determines how far the player turns per tap of the left/right
// arrow key.  In normal Quake, the keys turn the player gradually; holding
// them down turns the player more in that direction.  To make it easier for
// AGRIP players to get their bearings, turning is implemented by snapping the
// player a certain number of degrees in their desired direction.
// A value of 22.5 gives a 16-point turn (recommended for expert players),
// A value of 30 gives a 12-point turn (still practical to use),
// A value of 45 gives an 8-point turn (not recommended).
// default for turning value in degrees is 30


// SOUND VOLUME SETTINGS

// Here are various ``throttles'' for the sounds produced by the game objects.
// They allow you to tailor the sound levels these objects make.

setinfo agv_nav_wall_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sounds that walls make are.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for wall volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_nav_wall_touch_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sounds that walls make when you're touching
// them are.  It is scaled by the agv_nav_wall_volume_throttle value first.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for wall touch volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_nav_haz_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sound that indicates ledges/drops is
// played.  It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value
// is used otherwise.
// default for hazard volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_nav_corner_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sounds that indicates corners are played.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for corner volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_d5k_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sounds that the Detector 5000 makes are.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for D5k volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_esr_volume_throttle 1
// This controlls how loud the sounds that the EtherScan RADAR makes are.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for ESR volume throttle is 1
setinfo agv_marker_volume_throttle 0.25
// This controlls how loud the sound that waypoint markers make is.
// It must be a decimal value between 0 and 1 -- the default value is
// used otherwise.
// default for marker volume throttle is 0.3


// OTHER SETTINGS

// Here are the settings that cannot be neatly put into any other category.

serverinfo bots_clientcontrol 1
// Are clients allowed to add/remove bots?  You almost certainly want to have
// this option enabled.
// This setting only controls local games; server admins control the setting on
// public Internet servers.
// default for allowing bots (toggle) is 1 (on).
serverinfo bots_skill 1
// The skill level of bots in your own personal games.  There are three skill
// levels:
// 0 - bots stand still when attacking,
// 1 - they follow their enemy linearly when attacking,
// 2 - bots will strafe about their enemy when attacking.
// This setting only controls local games; server admins control the setting on
// public Internet servers.
// allowed values: 0 1 2
// default for bot skill (mode) is 1.
serverinfo bots_padclients 4
// Use bot padding in coop, dm and teamdm games?
// Bot padding is where a number of bots are spawned to fill in for players.
// They will be replaced as players connect.  You MUST specify the number of
// teams and their names in the next section if you enable this or the game
// will not know how you want to distribute bots.
// Entering 0 disables this option.
// default for number of client spaces to pad with bots is 4.
serverinfo ag_numteams 2
// The number of teams in team games.  This option assists the game when you
// want bots to pad out client slots.  It also allows you to force specific
// team names to be used even if you aren't using the bot padding feature.
// Use the ag_team[1234]name variables to set the team names you want to use.
// default value for number of teams is 2.
serverinfo ag_team1name red 
// Set team 1's name.
// default for team 1's name (string) is red.
serverinfo ag_team2name blue 
// Set team 2's name.
// default for team 2's name (string) is blue.
serverinfo ag_team3name yellow 
// Set team 3's name.
// default for team 3's name (string) is green.
serverinfo ag_team4name green 
// Set team 4's name.
// default for team 4's name (string) is yellow.
setinfo msg 0
// Enables you to get all game messages, from item pickups (level 0) through
// to death messages (level 1), critical messages (level 2) and chat messages
// (level 3).  To block messages with a priority of below a certain level,
// change the 0 above to the lowest level you want to recieve messages from.
+mlook
// Stops the player from automatically looking up/down slopes (amongst other
// things).
set s_khz 44
// mindgrid:audio Quake is sampled at CD quality, so we must have the engine
// downsample no lower than this.
// default for sound sampling frequency in kilohertz is 44.
set cl_writecfg 0
// Tells the client not to overwrite your config.cfg with the default values
// for keybindings and other settings.  Very useful, as some classic Quake
// keys get in the way for AGRIPers.
// default for overwriting config file with default values (toggle) is 0 (off).
cl_bob 0
// Don't bob up and down when walking/running.

// ALIASES

// There is no need for you to edit this section.

// This section simply sets up some ``friendly'' names for the commands
// that toggle the various gadgets and level indicators on/off.  You need to
// edit the key bindings section if you want to alter the key assignments.
// The idea of this section is to give easy-to-read names to the somewhat
// cryptic commands that the game uses internally.
