		<h1>AudioQuake &amp; Level Description Language</h1>
		<p><strong>$version</strong></p>

		<p>This is a re-release, with a new launcher and tools, that runs on contemporary macOS and Windows versions. What can you do with it?</p>

		<p>You can <strong>play</strong> the game. <em>Open Quartz</em> is available out-of-the-box. If you have the registered version of <em>Quake</em>, which is recommended, you can install its data via the launcher. Note that accessibility of the levels is variable!</p>

		<p>Try the accessible <strong>mapping</strong> tools a.k.a. the Level Description Language. The geometry is basic, but it lets you describe your own 3D spaces and then creates the playable maps for you, with your choice of texture and lighting styles.</p>

		<p>You can also play <strong>mods</strong> for the game, and make your own.</p>

		<p>Detailed info on all of the above is available from within the launcher&mdash;<strong>please read the docs :-)</strong>.</p>
