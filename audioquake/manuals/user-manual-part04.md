# Multiplayer Game Modes

Quake is not just a singleplayer fragfest\! In fact, many would say that it is far more fun to play over the Internet both with and against other humans. This part explains the variety of game modes on offer and how you can join in the fun.

AudioQuake gives you the ability to play true Internet multiplayer games in a variety of modes. You can also play offline practice games against computer-generated “bots”. This will allow you to hone your skills before joining real multiplayer games and allows you to play any time you like (not just when your friends are online).

Because the gametypes available are common to both practice matches and multiplayer games, the gametypes will be described in the next chapter. The following chapters detail how you can actually play practice matches and multiplayer games.

Finally, details are given on how you can run your own Quake server. This is allows you total control over the gametypes and maps you play, as well as broadening the availability of accessible Quake matches for others on the Internet (more on this later).

## Gametypes

This chapter details the three main multiplayer gametypes currently available in AudioQuake. At this time, three popular gametypes are on offer. More gametypes will be made available as AudioQuake develops.

### Deathmatch

The classic multiplayer game mode. No monsters to get in the way. No exit. An arena designed solely for combat between players.

In a deathmatch game, you have to move around the deathmatch arena (a special map designed to make this type of play more enjoyable through being easy to navigate) and find other players. You must *frag* (blow to bits) any players you do find along the way.

**Tip:** In deathmatch games, the ESR can detect your nearest enemy instead of the nearest monster (this behaviour is enabled by default).

#### Deathmatch Variations

There are a few different variations on how items behave in deathmatch games. These variants on the basic deathmatch rules are described below:

  - Deathmatch 1  
    Weapons disappear after being picked up but will *respawn* (come back) after a short delay. Items (powerups and ammo) will respawn. This is one of the most popular types of deathmatch and allows for more tactical gameplay because areas of the map that contain important weapons and/or items can be guarded.
  - Deathmatch 2  
    Weapons will not disappear after being picked up. Items (powerups and ammo) will disappear. This variation is hardly ever played; it’s a throwback to the old days of multiplayer Doom games.
  - Deathmatch 3  
    Weapons don’t disappear after being picked up. Items (powerups and ammo) will respawn. This is also one of the most popular types of deathmatch, especially with new players.

#### Frag and Time Limits

All multiplayer games go on for as long as it takes for one of the preset game limits to be reached. There are two main limits; the fraglimit and the timelimit.

The fraglimit is the target score for the match. The first player to get this many frags is the winner.

The above may take some time, so a timelimit is usually set. This ends the match after a specific number of minutes has gone past. The winner is the player with the highest number of frags at the end of this time.

### Team Deathmatch

This mode is similar to the last one but has one main difference: You are not on your own – you can have an epic battle in which all the players on your team are against all the players/bots on the enemy team\!

Team Deathmatch games are started in the same way as regular deathmatches and can have frag and time limits, except that the fraglimit is the number of frags that a team must score to win.

**Tip:** In team games, the ESR detects enemy players or bots, as it does in deathmatch. It can also detect your team mates. To help you distinguish between the two, it makes a different sound to represent team mates than it makes when it detects enemies.

To actively participate in team deathmatches, you must set your “teamname” the same as a group of other players on the map. You can do this using the following console command:

``` screen
team red
                
```

The above example would put you on the “red” team.

#### Additional Team Deathmatch Variations

Team deathmatch games are based on deathmatch games. Consequently, they can use any of the deathmatch variations discussed in the section on that gametype above. There are also a number of teamplay-specific variations which can be coupled with the deathmatch ones. They’re described below.

  - Teamplay 1  
    You can’t hurt yourself and you can’t hurt your teammates.
  - Teamplay 2  
    You can hurt yourself and your teammates. You’ll lose one frag for killing a teammate. This is pretty much the most popular teamplay mode.
  - Teamplay 3  
    You can hurt yourself but not your teammates. This mode is quite popular with new players.

### Co-Operative (“co-op”)

This is probably the most interesting game mode and has been the focus of many a LAN party. In this mode, you play the singleplayer campaign with the help of other players or bots. You can all work together against the monsters. Coupled with eh chat facilities on offer, this gametype can be very enjoyable.

**Tip:** As with deathmatch and team games, the ESR can help you out in co-op mode too. It will identify the nearest monster, enemy and team mate and will use a different type of sound for each.

## Offline Practice with Bots

This chapter explains how to play the gametypes listed above with bots, so that you can practice in preparation for real Internet games.

### Deathmatch

The quickest way to start a deathmatch game in the first deathmatch level is to enter the **dm** console command. However, you’ll find that this limits the variety of your games, as it always uses the same deathmatch mode and map. To customise the game mode and map, bring down the console and type:

``` screen
deathmatch mode
                
```

where *`mode`* is a number that corresponds to the variation on the weapon/item rules as described in the last chapter. For example, if you wanted to play the most popular type of deathmatch, you’d specify number one.

**Tip:** If you specify a zero in the above command, deathmatch mode is disabled. This (coupled with “maxclients 1”) switches you into singleplayer mode.

The above command simply tells the game that when you next start a map, you’ll want to play it in deathmatch. You now need to chose a map to play on. In the full version of Quake (not shareware), there are 6 deathmatch maps. They are named “dm1” to “dm6”. AudioQuake provides a number of extra maps. Use the “map” console command to load one of them (just as with single-player).

``` screen
map agdm01
                
```

When you’re in the map, you will notice that there is not much going on. To create (“spawn”) a bot, press the comma or dot key on your keyboard. An enemy will be provided for you to play with. When either of you is fragged, you’ll “respawn” at a random teleporter in the map, ready to resume the game – but with a slightly decreased frag count (your score).

Please note that the bots act like players; they use all the weapons and navigate the map on their own. In other words, they’re tough\!

**Note:** You *can* play deathmatch and other multiplayer gametypes on the singleplayer maps but it is not as fun due to them only having one spawnpoint and not looping back on themselves. A deathmatch game is only as good as the “flow” from room to room in the map.

#### Setting Frag and Time Limits

It is possible to set limits as described in the previous chapter. This section explains how to do this.

**Warning:** You must type in the commands described here before you open the deathmatch map you want to play on, or they won’t take effect.

To set the fraglimit, simply enter the following command in the console:

``` screen
fraglimit frags
                    
```

where *`frags`* is the number of frags a player must get to win the match. Set this depending on how many bots you expect to add. A good general value is 20. The time limit can be set similarly. To set a 10-minute time limit, for example, you’d enter the following into the console:

``` screen
timelimit 10
                        
```

### Team Deathmatch

Team Deathmatch games are started in the same way as regular deathmatches and can have frag and time limits. The previous section explains how to set these up. The important thing to note about starting team deathmatches is that the teamplay mode must be set before you open the map and start spawning bots. This can be achieved by using the simple **teamdm** console command. As above, you can take more control over the game mode and may by setting them manually – for example:

``` screen
teamplay 1
                
```

You can of course replace the number one above with the number corresponding to the teamplay rules you prefer (described in the previous chapter) or specify a zero to disable teamplay (useful when returning to a singleplayer game afterwards).

Once you’re in the game, you can spawn friendly bots with the comma key and enemy bots with the dot key. You can also call bots to your aid with the forward slash key. When they hear your call, they’ll let you know and try to get to you. If they make it, they’ll let you know when they arrive, too. When they get to your side, they’ll start looking for enemies again.

**Tip:** In team games, the ESR detects enemy players or bots, as it does in deathmatch. It can also detect your team mates. To help you distinguish between the two, it makes a different sound to represent team mates than it makes when it detects enemies.

### Co-Op

You can start a basic co-op game in the start map using the **co** console command. Once again, to get more control over the game, you can do things manually, as follows:

``` screen
deathmatch 0
teamplay mode
coop 1
                
```

Deathmatch mode needs to be disabled to allow access to the co-op gametype. The **coop** command toggles the game into co-operative mode and *`mode`* in the **teamplay** command signifies that you can, as with team deathmatch, choose which teamplay rules you’d like to use. After the above commands have been entered, you can start the map you wish to play. For example:

``` screen
map e1m1
                
```

As with team deathmatch practice games, you can spawn friendly bots with the comma key and enemy bots with the dot key. You can still call bots to your aid with the forward slash key. When they hear your call, they’ll let you know and try to get to you. If they make it, they’ll let you know when they arrive, too. When they get to your side, they’ll start looking for enemies again.

**Tip:** As with deathmatch and team deathmatch games, the ESR can help you out in co-op mode too. It will identify the nearest monster, enemy and team mate and will use a different type of sound for each.

## Playing Matches with other People

Now you know how to play the various game modes and have had some practice with bots, you are ready to pit your skills against the world\! This chapter explains how you can play games against other humans over the Internet.

### Multiplayer Basics

When you play any of the gametypes (singleplayer or practice matches) mentioned above, it is your computer that controls all aspects of the game – from the generation of game sounds to the behaviour of the monsters or bots you’re playing the game with. When you play a game over the Internet, this isn’t the case. What happens is that your computer connects to another computer which acts as a *server*. The server manages connections from all of the players and controls most game-related things (such as keeping track of players’ scores and movements round a map). Your computer still takes care of dealing with your input and playing back sounds, but it doesn’t control the match being played in any way.

So, to join an Internet game, you need to connect to a server that other people may also connect to. There are many QuakeWorld servers out there but most don’t provide the accessibility features that AudioQuake does. You’ll need to connect to a specific AudioQuake server in order to play the game.

**Note:** We’re hoping that AudioQuake will become popular enough that many people start running servers and many people start playing on these servers. This will mean that, as with sighted games, you’ll always be able to find some humans to game with. It will, however, take time for such networks to spring up. In the meantime, we’ve set up a couple of servers you can use, but please feel free (and encouraged) to set up your own servers for you and your friends\!

### Setting Your Player Information

When you install AudioQuake, your player name will be set to “AGRIPUser”. Before you join a multiplayer game, it is a very good idea to change this to something else, so that your friends can recognise you (and so that everyone has a different name).

To change your name, you can use the following console command:

``` screen
name yourname
                
```

Most characters are acceptable in player names. If you include any carets in your name, they won’t be displayed as they are a signal to Quake that you want the next character in your name to be displayed with a highlight.

If you’re going to be playing a team deathmatch game, you’ll probably want to give yourself a team (maybe the collective name that you and your friends play under, or perhaps a colour). You can do this with the **team**, as described in the first chapter of this part.

There are two other personalisations you can make regarding your appearance to others in multiplayer games. These are the colour of your character’s uniform within the game. The console commands **topcolor** and **bottomcolor** can be used to change these. We mention them here for completeness.

Now you’ve made yourself a little more unique in the virtual world, it is time to join a game…

### Joining a Game

We have set up a few game servers under the AGRIP banner (details can be found in an appendix), but you’re certainly not restricted to playing AudioQuake on one of these – in fact, we encourage you to seek out other servers on the Internet to play on and/or to set up a server of your own. This can be especially rewarding if you know a few people that you’d like to play the game with. Anyone who sets up a server (covered later in the manual) can have it automatically advertised to every other AudioQuake player, via the AGRIP master server. This keeps a list of all active AudioQuake game servers on the Internet. By using a program that searches this list (known as a *server browser*), you can find a game to join. As server admins are free to chose any gametype and selection of maps that their server runs, you should be able to find a match that suits your tastes.

To search for games over the whole Internet, you can use either the AudioQuake Stats and Servers site, or a command-line program called QStat. This is a very powerful, popular and accessible tool, which allows you fine control over your searches. For more information on using QStat, visit it’s web site at <http://www.qstat.org/>. Information on the AudioQuake Stats and Servers web site can be found [in the next chapter](#mmodes-statsnservers "Chapter 15. AudioQuake Stats and Servers Website").

When you’ve found a server to join, you can connect to it from within AudioQuake by issuing the **connect** command, specifying the IP address or host name of the server. For example, the following two commands both connect to the primary AGRIP server:

``` screen
connect agrip.org.uk
connect 195.137.71.106
                
```

Remember to seek out and join servers other than the official AGRIP ones, especially if they are geographically closer to you, as they’ll offer better performance. This will also encourage others to run third-party servers, thus spreading the AudioQuake work network.

### Chatting

When you’re in the game, you may notice some additional messages being announced, other than the usual item/powerup-related ones. These are chat messages that are being sent from one player to the other players on the server. You can send a chat message too; in the console, issue:

``` screen
say message
                
```

This will broadcast a message to all other players. Your message can contain spaces and there is no requirement to surround it in quotes. If you only want to send a message to your teammates (perhaps because it reveals where you are or some other tactical information), you can use the following command:

``` screen
say_team message
                
```

**Warning:** Be nice to the other people on the server – if you’re not, the server admin has the power to *kick* you from the game and ban you from reconnecting\!

#### Chat History

It’s quite likely that, in the heat of battle, you’ll miss some chat message uttered by other players. The following keys can be used to havigate around the chat history whilst you play:

  - To move back through the history, from the newest to the olders message, press PAGE UP. Your position in the list is remembered, even when new messages arrive.

  - To move from older to newer messages, press PAGE DOWN. Again, your position in the list is saved even when new messages come in.

  - Pressing END mutes all speech and moves you to the newest message in the history.

  - If you simply want to repeat the last message that came in, but don’t want to lose your place in the history, press HOME.

### Playing the Game

There is not much to say specifically about this stage, other than have fun\! Try to be considerate of your teammates, if you’re playing a team gametype. If not, then friendly competition is always good\!

#### Scores and Scoreboards

To view the current scoreboard press the TAB key. Players are listed from the leader down. Scoring is relatively simple; you get one frag for each enemy you kill. If you kill a team-mate or yourself, you lose a frag.

The scorebaord will display different information based on what game mode you’re playing in. Team information, for example, is displayed in team deathmatch games.

#### Online Statistics

As you play games on any of the public servers, your progress is tracked and can be viewed relative to that of other players on the web. Please read the section on the [AudioQuake Stats and Servers Site](#mmodes-statsnservers "Chapter 15. AudioQuake Stats and Servers Website") for more information.

### Leaving a Game

There are three main ways to leave a game:

  - Say bye to everyone and leave with the **disconnect** command. This will remove you from the game in progress, returning you to the console.

  - Network problems may forcibly disconnect you from the server. If this happens, you could try reconnecting with the **reconnect** command.

  - You may have been kicked from the server because of unacceptable behaviour. Leaving a game in this way is not recommended.

When you’ve left a game, you’ll be back at the console. From here you can quit AudioQuake, or start a new single or multiplayer game.

## AudioQuake Stats and Servers Website

This chapter describes the web-based extension to AudioQuake; what it is, why it’s here and how you can use it.

### What is it?

The Stats and Servers website is part of the online community surrounding AudioQuake. As well as [the community resources on the AGRIP Wiki](http://www.agrip.org.uk/CommunityResources), the Stats and Servers site exists to help you get more out of the game. By visiting the site, you can:

  - Track your progress as an AudioQuake player. Examine the statistics gleaned from your recorded frags when playing the game. These include your efficiency, kill ratio and overall rank.

  - Compare how you’re doing to other players via the global ranking tables. these list the top AudioQuake players in a number of orders and over varying timeframes.

  - Find Internet games using a web-based server browser (as opposed to using the command-line tool [QStat](http://www.qstat.org/)).

### Quick Tour

When you visit the stats and servers site, you’re presented with a number of choices on where to go. The main page lists the sections you can visit, providing a brief description of each one. The most important areas of the site fall under a few categories:

  - Pages containing global ranking tables, based on a number of criteria. They may be frags, efficiency, overall ranking or time-based (e.g. frags for the current day or month).

  - Detailed stats for each known AudioQuake player (accessed via global players list).

  - The active servers list.

  - Help and support in the form of a FAQ section.

You can skip to any section at any time by using the global navigation bar, which is present on most pages in the site.

### Getting Your Stats Included

To get your stats included, all you need to do is play on any of the public servers that advertise themselves as logging stats. Most servers do this; some may not (because they’re aimed at providing practice for new players, for example).

## Setting up and Running your own Server

Running your own AudioQuake server allows total control over which maps, gametypes and rules you play. It can also be a fun and rewarding thing to do. If you would like to try setting up your own server, we recommend that you have a go – it will provide you with your ideal game setup and other AudioQuake players with an extra place to play (if you run a public server).

### Clients and Dedicated vs. Listen Servers

Quake is a “client-server” game. This means that at any time, to play the game you need a client and a server. The client is the program that the user interacts with, that outputs audio/video and captures input (to be used when moving the player or typing in the console). The server runs the game itself. It controls the environment (lifts, buttons) and items in it (powerups, monsters) and keeps track of scoring in multiplayer games. If you’re playing a singleplayer game or practice match on your own computer, the client and the server are both running on your computer. If you’re playing an Internet multiplayer game, the server could be hundreds of miles away.

When setting up a server, the most fundamental decision is what type of server to set up. Dedicated servers are programs that only perform the task of running the game. They do not output any audio/video and don’t allow you to play a game on them directly. Listen servers, however, act as the singleplayer and offline game modes do – except that they allow connections from other players on the Internet. From your point-of-view, this makes listen servers “feel” very similar to the on or offline games you’ve been accustomed to playing up until now.

#### Why Use Dedicated Servers?

Though they may seem much more convenient and useful, it is generally seen as bad practice to run a listen server. The main idea is that there is a delay involved for all players on a server (measured by their “ping” time). This delay is introduced due to the fact that the player’s input and output data has to be transmitted over the Internet to and from the server. A player who is directly connected to a listen server has no delay and therefore the lowest ping time on that server. This gives them a great advantage when playing the game.

Most servers on the Internet are dedicated ones. They try to be as fair as possible with respect to ping times by being remote from all players. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you run a dedicated server if you can. Even if you only have one computer or the server is on your local network (and therefore quick to access) we still recommend you run a dedicated server because it’s the standard. The instructions in this chapter will assume you’re using a dedicated server but they will work similarly in listen mode.

Another advantage to dedicated servers (which is most likely welcomed by anyone setting one up) is that they don’t require terribly fancy computers to run on. This is partly because they don’t need to perform any rendering of audio/video data, which can take quite a lot of computing power.

### Public vs. Private and Stats Logging

This topic and many others is dealt with on the [Stats and Servers site](http://stats.agrip.org.uk/) (in the FAQ section) – be sure to check it out for the latest information.

### Interacting with the Server Directly

You can do all sorts of things with the server by interacting with its console when you start it. Tasks such as setting the gametype and map, getting status and kicking players (as well as chatting to the players from outside) can be done via the server’s console directly. However, this is not always practical (you may be in the game yourself when you want to change the map, for example). In this case, you can use the “remote console” admin feature. It is beyond the scope of this manual to explain, but you can find out a lot about it and many other features by using the approach detailed in [Appendix B, *Finding out More – The Web is Your Friend\!*](#ref-weblinks "Appendix B. Finding out More – The Web is Your Friend!").

It is recommended that you run a dedicated server on Linux, using the [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) program. This allows you to safely detatch from the machine without stopping the server. Furthermore, it is recommended that you copy the standard output of the server to a log file (this will help us fix bugs, should they arise).

### Configuring Your Server

It is very important that you configure your server properly before running it. To do this you will need to edit the `server.cfg` file, which lives in the `id1/` subdirectory of your AudioQuake installation. Please use a plain text editor on the file. There are many comments in the file that explain how to set things up, so they will not be reiterated here.

This section does, however, explain some of the more complex parts of the configuration.

#### Port

You may need your server to listen for incoming connections on a port other than the standard one (27500). This could be because of restrictions on your network, for example. To configure the server to listen on a particular port, you’ll need to specify the port you want it to listen on on the command line. The following is an example of setting the dedicated server to listen on port 4242.

``` screen
$ zqds [other options] -port 4242
                    
```

The port should show up in the Stats and Servers site, but it may be a good idea to remind your players to type in your server’s address in the form `hostname:port` when they wish to connect to it.

#### Map Cycles

You can specify a list of maps in your config file so that the server is not always playing on the same level. The server will move to the next map after each game is over. By making this list circular (i.e. after the last map, we tell the server to start again) we can keep the rotation going.

Here is an example of how you’d set up such a map cycle (or “rotation”) in `server.cfg`. Say you have four maps; A, B, C and D. You wish for them all to be used one after the other ad infinitum. Here is what you’d put into the config file:

``` programlisting
localinfo A B
localinfo B C
localinfo C D
localinfo D A
                    
```

**Note:** You can only specify two maps with each use of **localinfo** – you’re effectively telling the game which map is next given the current one.

### Admin Tasks

You’ll find yourself needing to carry out a number of tasks as an admin. To get the best information on how to do these jobs, please consult [Appendix B, *Finding out More – The Web is Your Friend\!*](#ref-weblinks "Appendix B. Finding out More – The Web is Your Friend!"). Also, please join the mailing list for server admins. We use it to provide a lot of useful information and arrange regular matches.
