**Abstract**

This is the developer manual and reference guide for developing with
AudioQuake (from engine and gamecode technology to Stats and Servers
infrastructure). We hope you'll find it helpful and informative. Please
help us improve these resources by reporting any bugs and/or submitting
update requests to `<docs@agrip.org.uk>`{.email}.

The AGRIP web site, which provides a number of resources for those using
and developing AudioQuake, can be found at: <http://www.agrip.org.uk/>

The latest version of this manual can be found at:
<http://docs.agrip.org.uk/>

The revision number of the manual follows the same format as the
AudioQuake version number. If the first two digits of the version
numbers match, the manual and AudioQuake will correspond. In the context
of development, this means that any modifications you make will be
compatible with that release series. If you are making a total
conversion, this will not be so much of a concern.
