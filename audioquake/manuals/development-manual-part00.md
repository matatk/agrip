**Abstract**

This is the developer manual and reference guide for developing with AudioQuake (from engine and gamecode technology to Stats and Servers infrastructure). We hope you’ll find it helpful and informative. Please help us improve these resources by reporting any bugs and/or submitting update requests to `<docs@agrip.org.uk>`.

The AGRIP web site, which provides a number of resources for those using and developing AudioQuake, can be found at: <http://www.agrip.org.uk/>

The latest version of this manual can be found at: <http://docs.agrip.org.uk/>

The revision number of the manual follows the same format as the AudioQuake version number. If the first two digits of the version numbers match, the manual and AudioQuake will correspond. In the context of development, this means that any modifications you make will be compatible with that release series. If you are making a total conversion, this will not be so much of a concern.
