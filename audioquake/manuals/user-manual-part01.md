# Introduction

This part of the manual aims to introduce AudioQuake and gives you details on how to get it set up on your computer.

## Important Note

AudioQuake builds on the foundation laid by AccessibleQuake. This is a tried-and-tested stable release, which allows you to take advantage of the new features that have been implemented over and above our previous game. Currently these are full support of Internet play, various related enhancements to the user interface and manual, a new setup routine and a large number of minor improvements to the gameplay. The other planned improvements will be introduced as we reach version 1.0.0.

By all means, join in the development and make AudioQuake what you want it to be. Feel free to give feedback on the [mailing lists](http://www.agrip.org.uk/CommunityResources/MailingLists), join the web community and voice your opinions. This project has always been and will always be what you make of it.

## What is AudioQuake?

AudioQuake is essentially a series of modifications to the game Quake by id Software that enable blind and vision-impaired people to play it. Actually, it is (or will be) quite a lot more than just that. This chapter explains the main things you need to know about AudioQuake to understand what it does and why it’s here.

So, AudioQuake is…

### More than just an “Accessible Game”

AudioQuake is based on earlier software from AGRIP called “AccessibleQuake”. The previous game’s ethos was to prove that accessibility barriers can be lowered and it allowed blind gamers to play singleplayer Quake (or offline multiplayer with computer-generated opponents). AudioQuake’s philosophy is to take this idea to its logical extreme and allow blind and vision-impaired players not only access to Quake, but *equal* access to both the game *and* the community of Internet play and level design and creation of new modified games that surrounds it. AudioQuake provides this via the following three main features:

  - Support for Internet multiplayer games in a variety of game modes such as co-operative, deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag (provided via our use of the ZQuake “QuakeWorld” game engine). The traditional singleplayer gametypes are, of course, supported.

  - “Implicit Accessibility” – The use of modern 3D audio and special effects technology to make the game inherently more accessible. This, in turn, means that the difference between the software that the sighted and blind use is dramatically minimised. For all intents and purposes, you’ll be playing *the same* game.

  - Accessible level-editing tools. These will allow you to create your own levels (“maps”) for the game; something that sighted gamers have been able to do for some time. Coupling this with the fact that you can create your own code modifications easily, AudioQuake could be used as a platform for making your own games\!

**Note:** Please remember that at the current stage of development only the first of these three features have been fully implemented. We await community feedback on how we’re doing so far and will continue to develop AudioQuake over time to bring you these benefits.

### Quake

At first it may seem obvious that AudioQuake is, well, Quake. This idea, however, has had a profound impact on how the game is designed. At all times, we have tried to maintain the spirit of Quake. You will not find a lot of voice-over information because Quake didn’t have it – our accessibility features are designed to use intuitive techniques and sounds so that you are not distracted from playing the game. We have only added the accessibility features necessary to play the game effectively. To keep things fair, we’ve not allowed AudioQuake players to do anything Quake players can’t (within reason).

This design philosophy comes across in the way the accessibility features present themselves in the game. The idea is that an AudioQuake player is no different than a Quake player, but they have in their possession certain “objects” that provide accessibility features such as enemy detection (the EtherScan RADAR), item detection (the Detector 5000) and navigation (the Navigation Helper). Many features can be toggled on or off according to your individual taste and level of sight.

**ImplicitAccessibility**

As AudioQuake development brings more of the key features mentioned above into play, these objects, or parts of them, should start to disappear. This is because the information they provide will be presented through the more realistic (audio) modelling of the environment.

We have tried our best to make it possible for AudioQuake players to use the original Quake maps. Currently there are a number of maps from the game that cam be played by blind players. A series of tutorial maps is provided to help you get used to the game and we hope to provide a range of custom-built accessible maps in the future.

In the end, the main point of AudioQuake is not to prove that video game accessibility is possible, as this has already been established. The main point is that *community* accessibility is possible – that blind and vision-impaired players can use *the exact same software*, join Internet games and contribute new maps and modifications, just as the sighted are able to.

#### Not for Under-15s

Quake has a “15” certificate. For obvious reasons, this also applies to AudioQuake. We do not recommend or condone the use of this software by anyone below 15 years of age.

### Customisable

The game has been built to be customisable. You can change a great many of the game-play aspects described below quite easily so that they suit your taste and style of play. We are here to cater for a large range of people from the blind to the vision-impaired. Everyone is different and we’re confident that you’ll get a lot more out of AudioQuake if you customise it.

The process of customisation is described [later on](#customising "Part VI. Customising AudioQuake"). It’s not difficult and there is help provided along the way. It is probably a good idea to read the next part and learn how to play the game before you delve in to tweaking it, however\!

### Free (as in Freedom)

Everything we have created for the project (code, sounds, tools) is available for you to use, modify and redistribute. The licence we have used for the project, the GNU General Public Licence, permits anyone to do these things as long as they keep the source code to their work available for others, just as we have for you.

Our reasons for making AudioQuake Free are that it should make it easier for people to get hold of and play the game. The most important reason, however, is described in the following section…

### Only the Beginning

We’re building not just a game, but a framework with which you can create your own games. This framework currently allows you to alter all aspects of the way the game works and sounds, with level editing planned for the future, as we get closer to the 1.0.0 version number.

With a number of commercial game engines now made Open Source, the possibility of making other titles accessible is a reality. Some even use the Quake engine – Half-Life would make a most amazing and immersive accessible game due to its amazing sounds, AI, story line and massively popular online game modes.

It is possible that later engines such as Quake3 and Unreal could be made accessible even without access to the engine code. We wanted to produce a Free game, which is why we didn’t choose these titles. We also thought that Quake would be a good starting point as it marked the dawn of modern game engine design.

We would love to see a community spring up around AudioQuake and make other games based on it. You can use any of our code and sounds. The techniques we’ve used should be applicable to newer engines, too.

## Installing AudioQuake

This chapter explains how to get the game set up on your computer and how to start it. For details on playing the game, please read the next part of the book. The [download page](http://www.agrip.org.uk/DownloadPage) on our web site provides all of the information you’ll need to get hold of the software. This section explains what to do after you’ve got hold of it.

### Why Quake is Required and How to Try Before You Buy

As explained above, AudioQuake is a series of modifications to the game Quake. For AudioQuake to function correctly, you must have Quake. Our website details [how you can get hold of the game](http://www.agrip.org.uk/DownloadPage/GettingQuake).

If you’re uncertain as to whether you should go to the trouble of getting hold of a copy of Quake, you can try running AudioQuake with the “shareware” version of the game. This is a demonstration version that only includes one of the four “episodes” of the full game. It contains no deathmatch arenas so two game modes (deathmatch and team deathmatch) will not be fully available. It should, however, give you a good idea of if AudioQuake is for you.

The setup program for AudioQuake will give you the option of having the shareware version of Quake automatically downloaded and installed. If you’ve got the full version of the game on CD, this isn’t necessary.

### mindgrid:audio

An excellent expansion pack has been created that upgrades many of the sounds in the game to much more high-resolution and visceral levels. You can elect to have this pack installed when you install the game – and it is highly recommended.

The pack was not made by AGRIP; more information on mindgrid:audio can be found [on its web page](http://www.mindabuse.com/mindgrid/audio/quake/).

### Installing AudioQuake on Linux

Currently, binary packages are available for PowerPC and x86 machines. To install the game from one of these packages, simply download it, ensure it is executable and run it. For example:

``` screen
$ ./AudioQuake-0.3.0_linux-ppc.run
                
```

Then simply follow the on-screen instructions.

**Note:** To ensure that you don’t lose any data from previous installations, the installer will back up your `.zquake` directory to a `dot-zquake-date` directory. This may be safely deleted when you’re usre that all is well with the new install.

### Installing AudioQuake on Windows

A setup program is provided to ease the task of getting AudioQuake up and running. Because some people may already have some of the speech software AudioQuake requires, we’ve created three different sizes of setup program. This means that you can download the smallest one you need. The following list should help you decide which size is appropriate for you:

  - The smallest download contains just AudioQuake. This is suitable for people who’ve either used AudioQuake before or already have Microsoft SAPI 5.0 or greater and the extra SAPI voices.

  - If you use Windows XP, you already have a suitable version of SAPI (5.0), but you may wish to install some extra voices (Mary and Mike) if you don’t already have these, as they’re much clearer than the voice Windows XP comes with by default (Sam). If this applies to you, choose the medium-sized AudioQuake download.

  - If you have an older version of SAPI than 5.0 (most likely if you’re running an earlier version of Windows than XP) you’ll need to download the largest AudioQuake setup program. This includes SAPI 5.1 and the additional voices mentioned above.

You only need to download *one* of the setup programs mentioned above. Once you’ve decided which you need (choose the largest one if you’re unsure), you can follow the installation procedure as described below:

1.  Download your chosen setup package from the [download page](http://www.agrip.org.uk/DownloadPage) on the AGRIP web site.

2.  Run the program you downloaded. The installer uses a familiar “wizard”-type interface and will guide you through the setup process.
    
    The setup program will automatically download and install the Shareware version of Quake for you, if you ask it to (likewise for mindgrid:audio). It will also offer you the choice of installing SAPI and/or the extra voices for Windows XP, if you downloaded one of the setup programs with speech components included.
    
    **Note:** If you have the CD version of Quake, you don’t need to install the shareware version – make sure that you ask the installer *not* to download it for you. Then, when you first run AudioQuake, you’ll be given the option of installing the game data from your CD.

You should now be ready to play the game – read on for information on how to do this…

### Installing from Source

If you’re a developer, or a curious user, you may be interested in looking at the source code for AudioQuake. Source packages are provided for both Linux and Windows. Instructions for installing AudioQuake from source are provided [in an appendix](#ref-installsrc "Appendix C. Installing AudioQuake from Source").
