# Reference Material

This section contains links to web sites I found useful whilst developing the AGRIP accessibility routines, as well as some new ones that have sprung up since.

Please note that for more general links, you might want to consult the [links page](http://www.agrip.org.uk/LinksPage) on the AGRIP Wiki.

### Version Control Systems

  - [The Subversion Book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
    An excellent reference on this VCS, which includes a great deal of useful information on VCSes in general.
  - [subversion.tigris.org](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
    The official home of Subversion.

### QuakeC

  - [GameCode and QuakeC pages on the AGRIP Wiki](http://www.agrip.org.uk/GameCode)
    These provide a very basic overview of how the Gamecode and QuakeC fit into the overall development system.
  - [QuakeC Manual 1.0 by Ferrara Francesco (frank@aerre.it)](http://tylee.f2s.com/agrip/ref/QCMAN10.TXT)
    A comprehensive guide to QuakeC from the basics to more advanced topics.
  - [QuakeC Reference Manual by David “DarkGrue” Hesprich (darkgrue@iname.com)](http://tylee.f2s.com/agrip/ref/QuakeC%20Reference%20Manual.doc)
    Another very good basics-to-advanced tutorial on QuakeC.
  - [The *Quake* Wiki](http://wiki.quakesrc.org/)
    This site contains a comprehensive list of QuakeC functions, their availability in different engines and standard engine extensions – and includes detailed information on most of them.
  - [Inside3D QuakeC Tutorials](http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/)
    Some great tutorials can be found here, but beware of the pop-ups :-S.
  - [AI Cafe Tutorials](http://www.planetquake.com/minion/tutorial%5Cmain.htm)
    Home of the TutorBot and some interesting tutorials on QuakeC and Bot AI.

### *Quake* Engines and Standards

  - [QuakeSrc.org – The *Quake* Standards Group](http://www.quakesrc.org/)
    *The* site for engine developers and modders — includes news and a list of extensions, with a community-based protocol for having new ones added.
  - [ZQuake Development Board](http://www.besmella-*quake*.com/scripts/zquake/index.cgi)
    A place to report bugs/fixes, ask questions and get help with adding new features to this amazing *QuakeWorld* engine.

### DocBook XML

  - [DocBook.org](http://www.docbook.org/)

  - [DocBook – The Definitive Guide](http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html)
    The complete reference manual.

### Perl

  - Perl Manual Pages
    If you’re on a UNIX-like system, “man perl” should give you all of the information you need. If not, try browsing the [resources at perl.org](http://www.perl.org/docs.html).

### Community and Historical Links

  - [id Software’s “idstuff” FTP directory](ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/)
    Provides source and binaries (including patches) for lots of id’s games and editing and development tools. Not all Open Source but worth a look\! Note that this is just for the technology; extra maps and most official bonus packs are distributed via different channels.
