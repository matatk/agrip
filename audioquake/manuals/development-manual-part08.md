## QuakeC

**Alas all of these links no longer work; they may be on archive.org.**

* [QuakeC Manual 1.0 by Ferrara Francesco (frank@aerre.it)](http://tylee.f2s.com/agrip/ref/QCMAN10.TXT)
    A comprehensive guide to QuakeC from the basics to more advanced topics.

    Another very good basics-to-advanced tutorial on QuakeC.
* [The *Quake* Wiki](http://wiki.quakesrc.org/)
    This site contains a comprehensive list of QuakeC functions, their availability in different engines and standard engine extensions&mdash;and includes detailed information on most of them.
* [Inside3D QuakeC Tutorials](http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/)
    Some great tutorials can be found here, but beware of the pop-ups :-S.
* [AI Cafe Tutorials](http://www.planetquake.com/minion/tutorial%5Cmain.htm)
    Home of the TutorBot and some interesting tutorials on QuakeC and Bot AI.

## *Quake* Engines and Standards

* [QuakeSrc.org&mdash;The *Quake* Standards Group](http://www.quakesrc.org/)
    *The* site for engine developers and modders &mdash; includes news and a list of extensions, with a community-based protocol for having new ones added.
* [ZQuake Development Board](http://www.besmella-*quake*.com/scripts/zquake/index.cgi)
    A place to report bugs/fixes, ask questions and get help with adding new features to this amazing *QuakeWorld* engine.

## Historical links

* [id Software's "idstuff" FTP directory](ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/)
    Provides source and binaries (including patches) for lots of id's games and editing and development tools. Not all Open Source but worth a look\! Note that this is just for the technology; extra maps and most official bonus packs are distributed via different channels.

### Version Control Systems

* [The Subversion Book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
    An excellent reference on this VCS, which includes a great deal of useful information on VCSes in general.
* [subversion.tigris.org](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
    The official home of Subversion.

### Perl

* Perl Manual Pages
    If you're on a UNIX-like system, "man perl" should give you all of the information you need. If not, try browsing the [resources at perl.org](http://www.perl.org/docs.html).

### DocBook XML

* [DocBook.org](http://www.docbook.org/)
    Provides some general information on the standard.
* [DocBook&mdash;The Definitive Guide](http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html)
    The complete reference manual.
