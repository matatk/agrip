Building AudioQuake
===================

AudioQuake can be built into a stand-alone application for Mac or Windows. This can be run directly by the user, without having to install anything. This file documents the following four main steps:

-   Getting your development environment set up for the first time (this differs between Mac and Windows).
-   Getting the AudioQuake code and required libraries.
-   Compiling the engine on Windows (this is automated on the Mac).
-   Running the build script to produce a stand-alone AudioQuake application.

Please note that builds are platform-specific, i.e. if you build on the Mac, you will get a Mac version of AudioQuake; if you build on Windows you'll get a Windows version. You can only build an AudioQuake package for the OS you're running.

First-time set-up: Mac
----------------------

These instructions were tested on macOS Mojave (10.14.4).

### Pre-requisites

-   To compile anything and to use the suggested package manager, you will need the XCode command line tools to have been installed. You can do this by running `xcode-select --install`.
-   We strongly recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) as this makes the installation and update of third-party libraries and tools easy.
-   We also strongly recommend that you install the packages `git` and `bash-completion` (which allows you to quickly tab-complete many commands) to make working on the command line easy. Do this by running `brew install bash-completion` and `brew install git`. If you prefer a graphical UI for Git (and GitHub), you can install [GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com).
-   Make sure you've added homebrew's install location, `/usr/local/`, to your path, so that later on when you install Python via homebrew, it will run that version rather than the macOS system version.

After the above steps, you should end up with something like the following in your `~/.bashrc` fileâ€”you'll probably need to restart your shell for this to take effect.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion
fi
```

### Python

We recommend installing your own Python and not using the system one: this makes it easy to clean up any third-party libraries you install, and to control precisely which Python version is used.

-   Install Python 3.x with: `brew install python`.
-   To test it's set up correctly, run `which python3` and you should find that the result is: `/usr/local/bin/python3` (if it's not pointing to the correct python then later on you will get errors about missing packages even if you've installed them).

### The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library

You will also need the SDL library and development files: `brew install sdl`

First-time set-up: Windows
--------------------------

**TODO: work is still needed to get things back fully up-and-running on Windows.**

These instructions have been tested on Windows 10 (64-bit).

### Visual Studio

-   [Download Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
-   When installing:
    -   In "Workloads" choose "Desktop development with C++"
    -   In the "Installation details" section (a list of checkboxes) be sure to select "C++ MFC for v142 build tools"

### Python

-   [Install Python 3.x](http://www.python.org/downloads/).

Getting the AudioQuake code and Python libraries
------------------------------------------------

The following instructions give the Git command lines you need to complete them, but you can always use the [GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com) GUI app if you prefer.

-   Get the code by cloning from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/matatk/agrip.git`

    There are two main branches in this repo: "master", where the AudioQuake development is done, and "gh-pages" which holds the AGRIP website. You need to be on the "master" branch, in the `audioquake/` directory, to peform the rest of these steps.

-   Finally you can install the third-party Python libraries that AudioQuake needs: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Compiling the Engine (Windows-only)
-----------------------------------

**TODO: Update solution files in repo?**

On Windows this must be done separately to the main build process. The main build script will pick up the compiled engine and QuakeC compiler binaries during the build process.

-   To compile the ZQuake engine, go to the `audioquake\zq-repo\zquake\source\` folder and open `zquake.sln`. Be sure to select the whole solution in the "Solution Explorer" and then select the "GLRelease" configuration on the main Visual Studio toolbar before buidling the project. When the project is built, you will get the server, client/server and client binaries (only the first two are needed).
-   You'll also need to compile the QuakeC compiler. Go to the `audioquake\zq-repo\zqcc\` folder and open `zqcc.sln`. Select the "Release" configuration and build.

Running the build script
------------------------

The result of the build process is a stand-alone application that can be run on a given platform (an .app bundle on the Mac; a simple folder on Windows). To run a build, the steps are as follows.

1.  If you are using Windows, ensure you've compiled the engine and QuakeC compiler, as above (you don't need to do this if they have not changed since the last build).
2.  Run the build script to perform all the steps above and create the standalone application.
    - **Mac:** `python3 build.py`
    - **Windows:** `python build.py`

There is a clean-up script (`clean.py`) to tidy things up (i.e. remove the compiled code, data files and downloaded assets) so that the repo is back to the state it was in when cloned.

### What does the build script do?

-   (On the Mac) compiles ZQuake and zqcc (the gamecode compiler).
-   Compiles the QuakeC gamecode.
-   Converts the user manual, sound legend appendix (so it can be referred to separately), development manuals, README and LICENCE files from Markdown to HTML.
-   Checks if you have local copies of the various game data files, as follows, and downloads them for you if not.
    -   AudioQuake maps (i.e. compiled, `.bsp` versions of the maps in the git repo).
    -   AudioQuake demos.
    -   Standard skins.
    -   Shareware Quake data.
    -   Mindgrid sounds.
-   Runs [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org) to "freeze" the Python code (so that it runs like a normal executable, without requiring Python on the player's computer) and combine it with the engine binaries and all the data mentioned above.
